## Description
This application was designed to help users track their money - even while traveling! Users are able to update their expenses and deposits while offline, and the data will be updated when the application resumes online connectivity. 

## Installation
This application was built using basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the npms and helpers listed below.

Required npms:
- [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression)
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)
- [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)

## Usage
To access the program via `localhost`, a connection to the server must be made using MongoDb. After installing the necessary npms and providing the database access criteria, the connection can be made using the terminal CLI by evoking `npm start`. Alternatively, a link to the deployed online application is available below.
